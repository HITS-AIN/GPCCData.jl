The physical properties are:

bhm  = 2.8e7
eddington ratio = 5%

The folder has two files: 
MGC0811_opt.txt : Light curves for filters u,g,r,i,z with wavelenghts:
u = 3600.0
g = 4800.0
r = 6300.0
i = 7700.0
z = 9100.0

First column: Filters name
Second column: Days
Third column: fluxes
Fourth column: error fluxes

The second file: MGC0811_5100.txt has the light curve at one specific band called
5100 with wavelength 5100.0

First column: Days
Second column: fluxes
Third column: error fluxes

This light curve is separated from the other because it is from another paper.
