## ðŸ’¾ Installation 

This package is registered with [AINJuliaRegistry](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/AINJuliaRegistry).
Please add `AINJuliaRegistry` in order to use package.
Install with `add GPCCData` in package mode once `AINJuliaRegistry` has been added to your Julia installation.

## â–¶ Available functions

The package exports three functions called `listdatasets`, `readdataset` and `plotdataset`.

## â–¶ Examples

See a brief description in "help mode" with e.g. ?readdataset.

```
using GPCCData
using PyPlot # must be independently installed

days, flux, stdflux, bandfilenames = readdataset(source="Mrk6")

figure(1) ; cla()

for i in 1:length(days)
  errorbar(days[i], flux[i], yerr=stdflux[i], fmt="o", label=bandfilenames[i])
end

legend()
```

Alternatively, one can conveniently plot a dataset using e.g. `plotdataset(source = "Mrk6")`.

To get a  list of the available datasets call `listdatasets()`.

Example: plot all available datasets:
```
map(source -> plotdataset(source = source), listdatasets())
```
